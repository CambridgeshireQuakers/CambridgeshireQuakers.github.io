Cambridge Quakers have for many years
made their rooms at the Friends Meeting
House, Jesus Lane available to community,
voluntary and educational organisations for
meetings, classes and other functions.

Requests for lettings for a wide range of
purposes can be considered. However,
we do not allow use for ticketed events
or for parties or receptions. No smoking
or consumption of alcoholic drinks is
permitted.

A printable copy of our brochure is available for download
<a target="_blank" href="/asset-site/jesus-lane/hirers.pdf">here</a>
and our overall lettings policy is available for download
<a target="_blank" href="/asset-site/jesus-lane/letting-policy.docx">here</a>.

Copies of the Standard Terms
and Conditions for lettings are available on
request.

The Friends Meeting House is cared for by
resident Wardens and two Assistant Wardens.
who are available whenever the Meeting House is
open. They hope you will find a quiet and friendly
atmosphere here, and welcome your comments on
the facilities provided.
