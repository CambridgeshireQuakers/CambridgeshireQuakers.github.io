Children and families are very welcome at Jesus Lane Meeting.

### Meeting for Worship (Sunday 10.30 - 11.30 am)

Children of all ages are encouraged to join the first 15 minutes (10.30-10.45). We welcome the burblings of babies and small children and enjoy their contributions. Children often sit together in a cosy corner of the room with optional quiet activities. Children’s books, quiet toys, small chairs and cushions are available.

Some children prefer a shorter time of quiet worship. If children wish to leave early, parents/guardians are welcome to supervise their children in a nearby separate room (called Aldren Wright) until 10.45.

### Children’s Meeting

At 10.45 Children’s Meeting begins in the Aldren Wright room. A variety of themed activities are offered, in turns: Quaker spirituality, exploring nature, cooperative games, care for the environment, plant-based cooking, craft, stories and music. Sometimes a special guest shares from their life experience. All activities aim to promote community and a sense of fun, which helps welcome visitors. For the youngest children, a variety of toys and simple craft materials are available. Parents are welcome to stay with their children or return to the Meeting Room.

We aim to provide a safe, enjoyable, calm and accepting space where children may explore ideas with a Quaker outlook; build on friendships between children, parents and helpers; question and explore, using drawing, painting, singing, role play, co-operative games as well as free play. We encourage freedom of expression within appropriate boundaries. Sessions take into account a variety of different backgrounds and interests that children bring. Two DBS-checked adults are present at each Children’s Meeting.

### After Meeting

Children may rejoin their parents in the Meeting Room (or later downstairs) and are encouraged to stay for drinks and biscuits. Children are welcome to play in the garden with the box of toys. There are children’s books to read in the library and these may also be borrowed. Children remain their parents’ responsibility beyond Children's Meeting.

### All-age worship

Twice a year adults and children worship together as a single community for the whole hour. This time begins with brief prepared ministry, followed by quiet guided activities (optional). Past sessions have included:

- A play about the early Quaker story of the White Feather
- A story about the Cadbury Brothers and their chocolate factory
- Quaker work and worship in other parts of the world
- Writing haikus around the theme of the environment

### Additional activities

Usually on third Sundays after Meeting there is ‘singing together’ and a bring and share meal. All children are welcome. There are occasional trips out, such as picnics. Periodic all-age family social activities have included a Bonfire Night. In the autumn there is a weekend residential trip.
