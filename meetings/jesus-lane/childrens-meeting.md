Children and families are very welcome at Jesus Lane Meeting.

### Meeting for Worship (Sunday 10.30 - 11.30 am)

Children of all ages are encouraged to join the first 15 minutes (10.30-10.45). We openly welcome the burblings of babies and small children and we enjoy their contributions. Children’s books, booster seats and cushions are available.

### Children’s Meeting

At 10.45 Children’s Meeting begins in the Aldren Wright room. A variety of themed activities are offered on a rotating basis: exploring (themes or the outdoors), cooking, drama, and craft. On fifth Sundays we share in games or music. Sometimes we have a special guest and topic. All activities aim to promote community and a sense of fun, which helps welcome visitors. For the youngest children, a variety of toys are available. Parents may stay with their children or return to the Meeting Room.

We aim to provide a safe, enjoyable, calm and accepting space where children may explore ideas with a Quaker outlook; build on friendships between children, parents and helpers; question and explore, using drawing, painting, singing, role play, co-operative games as well as free play. We encourage freedom of expression within appropriate boundaries. Sessions take into account a variety of different backgrounds and interests that children bring.

Two DBS-checked adults are present at each Children’s Meeting.

### After Meeting

Children meet their parents downstairs and a special children's table is provided for them with drinks and biscuits. Children may play in the garden with the box of toys. There are children's books to read in the library and these may also be borrowed. Children remain their parents’ responsibility.

### All-age worship

Twice a year adults and children worship together for the whole hour with guided activities. Sessions have included:

- A play about the early Quaker story of the White Feather
- A story about the Cadbury Brothers and their chocolate factory
- Quaker work and worship in other parts of the world
- Writing haikus around the theme of the environment

### Additional activities

Every third Sunday after Meeting there is ‘singing together’ and a bring and share meal. All children are welcome. There are occasional trips out in summer, such as a picnic on Jesus Green and punting on the Cam. All-age family social activities have included a Bonfire Night. In the autumn there is a weekend trip to a windmill on the North Norfolk coast.
