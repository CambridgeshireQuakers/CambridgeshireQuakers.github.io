Children and families are very welcome at Jesus Lane Meeting.

### Meeting for Worship (Sunday 10.30 - 11.30 am)

Children of all ages are encouraged to join the first 15 minutes (1030-1045). We openly welcome the burblings of babies and small children and many members enjoy their contributions. Children’s books, booster seats and cushions are available.

### Younger children's meeting

Most children in this Meeting are under nine years old. They play with toys, draw or read books. Parents may stay or return to the meeting. There is sometimes a themed play.

We have also been combining the younger and older groups, depending on activities.

### Older children's Meeting

We aim to provide a safe, enjoyable, calm and accepting space where children may: explore ideas within Quaker philosophy; build on friendships between children, parents and helpers; question and explore, using drawing, painting, singing, role play, co-operative games as well as free play. We encourage freedom of expression within appropriate boundaries. Sessions are run on themes, such as Inspirational People, Questions and Queries, Quakerism and Emotional Well-Being.

### CRB checks

Two CRB-checked adults are always present in each childrens' group. At least once a month all ages are together and a guided activity is provided.

### After Meeting

Children meet their parents downstairs and a special children's table is provided for them with drinks and biscuits. Children may play in the garden with the box of toys. There are children's books to read in the library and these may also be borrowed. Children remain their parents’ responsibility.

### All-age worship

Twice a year adults and children worship together for the whole hour with guided activities. Sessions have included:

- A play about Mary Fisher's journey to meet the Ottoman Sultan
- A play called ‘The Slave Wedding’ about John Woolman
- Art promoting peace including collaged doves
- Sharing of special objects encouraging ministry
- Making angel cards carrying meaningful messages
- Writing haikus around the theme of the environment

### Additional activities

Every third Sunday there is 'singing together' and a bring and share meal. All children are welcome. A weekend trip to a windmill on the North Norfolk coast in spring and autumn. Occasional trips out in summer, such as a picnic on Jesus Green and punting on the Cam.
