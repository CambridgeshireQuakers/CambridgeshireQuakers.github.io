Quakers at Hartington Grove have for many years made their facilities at their Meeting House available to community, educational and voluntary organisations for meetings, classes and other functions.

There are two large and two small rooms, and a kitchen. All are light and airy, on the ground floor, are suitable for wheelchair access and we have an accessible toilet. There is also car parking available.
