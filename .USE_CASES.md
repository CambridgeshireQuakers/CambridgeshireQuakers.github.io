As a member or attender I would like to know:

- Times, dates, and locations of Area Meeting
  - Agendas and minutes
- Times, dates, and locations of Local Meetings for Business
- What else is going on (where, when, how to sign up) in the Area

... so that I can attend AM events and LM events at which I would be welcome

----

As a clerk, I would like to publicise AM events or LM events.

----

What do other AMs do?

- Typically each LM has its own page (Glos Quakers, Lincolnshire Quakers, Central England Quakers); Sometimes each LM has an item in a listing of all meetings (Bristol Quakers).
- Sometimes the website is really an LM website with other LMs' contact details added in, possibly with their own pages. (Saffron Quakers, Leicester Quakers).
- Sometimes LMs have their own websites (Watford).
- There are other models (Yorkshire has a Quarterly Meeting).

The proposed model is that:

- The AM should have a website, which includes
  - at least one page for each LM.
  - at least a brief introduction to Quakers and directions to more in-depth resources
- Where possible, LMs should use the AM website. Typically a LM will have 1-5 pages.
- Good resources should be linked to and not copied. Has it been better said elsewhere? Is there something unique this AM or LM has to offer?
  - LM pages should be concerned with parochial matters and avoid duplication.
- AM events and LM events to which other AM members are welcome should be posted as events which will be available on the home page and the page of the hosting meeting.
- LMs who are able to maintain a much larger online presence relating to their local activity should manage their own website, but should still keep an overview page on the AM website.

# Overall goals

The website should be:

- Accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments, browsing on mobile devices, etc.
- Intuitive to use, following modern navigational conventions
- Discoverable - Meetings, Events, and Room Hire are key 'landing pages'.
- High-performance, with low demands on bandwidth, server, and client
- Transparent - it should be possible to understand how to add to and amend the website
- Presentable - the design should not distract by making the site seem ill-cared-for or gaudy; it should allow the content and the navigation to take the fore.
