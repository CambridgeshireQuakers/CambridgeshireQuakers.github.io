# This layout is for meetings and pages about the meeting community.
#
# Itâ€™s not suitable for events or pages like room hire pages which may need the
# full width of the page (and are not targeted at enquirers/visitors/attenders).
#
# The page content will be shown on the left and the meeting contact details and
# a list of upcoming events on the right.
#
# Microdata:
#
# If the page is the meeting page itself, then the page will be tagged
# as a place of worship.
#
# Additionally, if the page has a true eventVenue flag (i.e. it is a meeting
# house), the page will be tagged as an Event Venue.
