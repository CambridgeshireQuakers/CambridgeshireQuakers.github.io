We are supporting work in war-torn Eastern Congo. Local Quakers there are building a centre for counselling traumatised victims of the war, running a local hospital and supporting a microcredit scheme for local women.

This work began in 2008 as a collaboration between Quakers from Area Meetings in Cambridgeshire and Manchester and Quakers from the Community of Evangelical Friends' Churches in Congo, and continues in the form of the [Quaker Congo Partnership UK](https://www.quakercongo.org.uk).
