# Area Meeting Reports and Minutes

It has been our custom at Area Meeting to post reports presented to AM on the website before we meet; highlights are presented when we gather so there is more time for discussion and more focus on key issues.

You should see a list of meetings below, ordered by date (Year, Month) - scroll down to see the latest. You can also find these on [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B671MXCtevbrOTE2YjRhZDMtODQyNi00ZDZlLTlmODEtNTgyMTQxMDkwYmMz)
