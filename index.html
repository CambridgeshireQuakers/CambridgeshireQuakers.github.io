        This is the website for the
        <b>Cambridgeshire Area Meeting</b>
        of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>Area Meeting</b> brings together <b>eight Local Meetings</b>
        in Cambridgeshire (listed below),
        and gathers several times a year.

        Area Meetings are the "primary meeting for church affairs", and we meet
        to discuss matters of common concern,
        to share our successes and challenges,
        to build a welcoming community beyond the Local Meeting
        and to connect us with the wider family of Friends.
      </p>
