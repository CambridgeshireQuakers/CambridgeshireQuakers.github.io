Wisbech Meeting is a small meeting of long standing. Quakers have met for worship at the same site on North Brink since 1711, and in the current Meeting House since 1854. Much of our history is connected with the Peckovers, a Quaker banking family who owned nearby Peckover House, now a National Trust property.

We meet for worship at 10:00 on Sundays, with coffee and conversation at 11:00, occasionally followed by meetings for learning and discussion.
Although we do not currently have a childrenâ€™s meeting, we are able to create one at short notice should any visitors with children wander in.

The meeting room itself and the coffee room are used during the week by various community groups and charities. Contact us for more details if you are looking for a place to meet.
