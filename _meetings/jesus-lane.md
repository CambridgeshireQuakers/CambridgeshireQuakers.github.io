Jesus Lane is a busy meeting, which often has 50-60 Friends gathered on Sundays,
meeting from 1030-1130am. We have [family-friendly arrangements](/meetings/jesus-lane/childrens-meeting.html) for Sunday worship.

Tea and coffee follows Meeting for Worship, as well as other regular activities which you are welcome to stay for:

- **Local Meeting for Business** is held on the first Sunday of each months (except January and August)
- **Singing Together** takes place at 1200 on the third Sunday of each month
- Also on third Sundays we have a **bring-and-share lunch**.

You are welcome to join us for either or both of a **Meeting for Worship on Wednesdays** from 1315-1345, preceded most weeks by a Soup and Cheese lunch at 1230, or for our regular **drop-in silence every Friday**: stay as long as you like, leave when you want (also an opportunity to browse our Library).

We hold monthly **Evening Meetings for Worship** on Tuesdays, in which we explore different topics, and Friends
from across the Cambridgeshire Area are meeting on Monday evenings during term time for regular one-off discussions entitled
**Ideas Online**.

Please get in touch to sign up to our weekly email to find out about upcoming events and for connection details for joining us online.

Note: Please do not come to the Meeting House if you are experiencing COVID-like symptoms.

### Winter 2022-2023: Warm Wednesdays

Jesus Lane Meeting has been awarded a micro grant of £1000 by Cambridge City Council to support the cost of offering a quiet warm space in Ann Docwra every Wednesday 9.30 - 5.30 between October 19th - End of March 2023.

We hope that this offer will be of benefit for people experiencing fuel poverty. We think it may be of particular interest to people now expected to work from home who may be worried about their fuel bills. We plan to offer a friendly welcome, free wifi, tables for home working (max 5) free tea/coffee, soup lunch (for a donation) and quiet activities with access to light reading, jigsaw puzzle, board games, occasional crafts, social chat etc.

### Getting to the Meeting House

{% include image.html src='/img-site/jesus-lane/outside.jpg' class='thumbnail-left' caption="The front door of Jesus Lane Meeting House" %}

Jesus Lane Meeting house is close to the city centre, situated at the corner of Jesus Lane and Park Street, and next to the ADC Theatre.

There is a large **cycle park** immediately outside the Meeting House.

Several city and country **bus** routes pass near the Meeting House. Drummer Street bus station is within ten minutes’ walk.

The nearest **car parks** are Castle Hill and the Grafton Centre, as Park Street **car park** is no longer in operation.

**Park & Ride** bus service from Madingley Road car park stops at Bridge Street, within five minutes’ walk.

There is a designated parking bay for **Blue Badge holders** opposite 6—11 Jesus Lane; approach via Jesus Lane only.

### History of Jesus Lane Meeting

Quakers first held meetings
in Jesus Lane in the 1650s. Parts of the
present Meeting House date from 1777 and
there have been additions and rebuildings
at various times in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries.

Today, Friends still meet each Sunday and
Wednesday for worship based in silence.

We warmly welcome anyone who feels
drawn to experiencing Quaker worship.
