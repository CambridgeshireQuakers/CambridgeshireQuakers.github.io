Jesus Lane is a busy meeting, which often has 50-60 Friends gathered on Sundays,
meeting from 9am-10am and 1030am-1130am. We have [family-friendly arrangements](/meetings/jesus-lane/childrens-meeting.html) for Sunday worship.

Tea and coffee follows Meeting for Worship, as well as other regular activities which you are welcome to stay for:

- **Local Meeting for Business** is held on the first Sunday of each months (except January and August)
- **Singing Together** takes place at 1215 on the third Sunday of each month
- Also on third Sundays we have a **bring-and-share lunch**.

You are welcome to join us for either or both of a **Meeting for Worship on Wednesdays** from 1315-1345, preceded every week by a Soup and Cheese lunch at 1230, or for our regular **drop-in silence every Friday** from 1700-1800: stay as long as you like, leave when you want (also an opportunity to browse our Library).

We hold monthly **Evening Meetings for Worship** on first (online) and third (in-person) Mondays, in which we explore different topics, and Friends
from across the Cambridgeshire Area are meeting on alternate Monday evenings during term time for regular one-off discussions entitled
**Ideas Online**.

Please get in touch to sign up to our weekly email to find out about upcoming events and for connection details for joining us online.

Note: Please do not come to the Meeting House if you are experiencing COVID-like symptoms.

There is a large **cycle park** immediately outside the Meeting House.

Several city and country **bus** routes pass near the Meeting House. Drummer Street bus station is within ten minutes’ walk.

The nearest **car parks** are Castle Hill and the Grafton Centre, as Park Street **car park** is no longer in operation.

**Park & Ride** bus service from Madingley Road car park stops at Bridge Street, within five minutes’ walk.

There is a designated parking bay for **Blue Badge holders** opposite 6—11 Jesus Lane; approach via Jesus Lane only.

### History of Jesus Lane Meeting

Quakers first held meetings
in Jesus Lane in the 1650s. Parts of the
present Meeting House date from 1777 and
there have been additions and rebuildings
at various times in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries.

Today, Friends still meet each Sunday and
Wednesday for worship based in silence.

We warmly welcome anyone who feels
drawn to experiencing Quaker worship.
