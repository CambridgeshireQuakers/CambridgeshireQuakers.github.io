Jesus Lane is a busy meeting, which often has 50-60 Friends gathered on Sundays, meeting from 1030-1130am. We have [family-friendly arrangements](/meetings/jesus-lane/childrens-meeting.html) for Sunday worship.

### During the pandemic

We have been worshipping online weekly at our usual time throughout the pandemic.

We welcome visitors to our Meetings for Worship on Sundays at 1030-1130 and Wednesdays at 1315-1145; these are are currently 'blended': most attending online with some at the Meeting House which also has a video link to the online space.

- To register to attend a Meeting in person, please contact our Warden in advance, preferably by email to [jlwardens@gmail.com](mailto:jlwardens@gmail.com).
- To join us online, please contact [clerk@cambridgeshire-quakers.org.uk](mailto:clerk@cambridgeshire-quakers.org.uk)

Following Meeting there is the opportunity for those meeting online to chat in small groups of 3-5 Friends in 'breakout rooms'.

We hold in-person worship primarily because we know some Friends have difficulty accessing online meetings;
please only come if you can do so safely and your place has been confirmed, and please follow the safety directions you will be given.

Our meetings for business are currently being held online at 1215 on first Sundays only and for practical reasons in-person meetings are not being held on the first Sunday in the month.

Our monthly Tuesday evening discussion meetings are not taking place currently, but Friends from across the Cambridgeshire Area are meeting on Monday evenings during term time for regular one-off discussions entitled "Ideas in Isolation". Please get in touch if you would like to join.

#### If you need additional support

Overseers are here to offer pastoral care to any attender or member who needs or wants it.
As we are not (in the main) meeting physically now, we would like to ask you to consider
drawing our attention to those that could benefit from some extra support.
We are also here for you to reach out directly to us.
The current overseers are:
Liz Barrow, Tamsin Beevor, Bea Doubleday, Amy Ellis, Marisa Johnson, Jeremy Symes and Robin Tod.
Please email us on [jl-overseers@cambridgeshire-quakers.org.uk](mailto:jl-overseers@cambridgeshire-quakers.org.uk)

Overseers would like you to know that there will be a welcoming overseer on Zoom from 10am each Sunday
so if you would like to arrive early for a chat please do so.
We are giving this idea a trial for one month in February 2020.

### History of Jesus Lane Meeting

Quakers first held meetings
in Jesus Lane in the 1650s. Parts of the
present Meeting House date from 1777 and
there have been additions and rebuildings
at various times in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries.

Today, Friends still meet each Sunday and
Wednesday for worship based in silence.

We warmly welcome anyone who feels
drawn to experiencing Quaker worship.
