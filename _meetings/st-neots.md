St. Neots is a newly formed – in January, 2017 – Local Quaker Meeting whose growing membership is deeply engaged in seeking to live out our faith in the world.

We meet on Sundays at 1030-1130am in St. Neots Museum on New Street, by the Market Square. In our worship we hope to both deepen and broaden our understanding of revealed truth through the light of divine love so that we can enhance our witness in the world.

Much is achieved through our serious commitment and the humour we find in our lives together. We are regularly represented at the weekly peace vigil in St. Neots, hold programmed Meetings for Worship, followed by a shared lunch, on Peace Sunday and have representatives at Churches Together in St. Neots. In June, 2017, we arranged an exhibition of the Fellowship of Reconciliation’s quilt commemorating those killed by the military use of drones. Our members are active, too, in providing support for the World Wide Connection and for Shoes for Children in The Gambia.

We have held street stalls outside the museum and at the market, with the intention of pursuing this further. We are looking at the possibility of taking part in “thought for the Day” programmes on local radio stations. The Meeting is looking at ways to engage more directly in the community through the development of Friends and Neighbours groups and exploring issues around poverty in the town.

We look forward too welcoming all who would share our worship, whether members or seekers.
