Our Worshipping Group was formed to meet a need for a small, quiet Meeting for Worship,
where those attending can get to know each other well, both on a personal level and more deeply.

Oast House Meeting was laid down in September 2021, and Friends regularly attending the Meeting
are now meeting in person on the third Sunday of the month in the Fox Room at Hartington Grove
Meeting House. We are now known as Pembroke Friends (as our Meeting met in Pembroke College until
2020). Visitors are very welcome.

It is our hope that our occasional visitors and new attenders also find us friendly and welcoming.
