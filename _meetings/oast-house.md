The Oast House Worshipping Group was formed to meet a need for a small, quiet Meeting for Worship,
where those attending can get to know each other well, both on a personal level and more deeply.

In 2021 we were laid down as a separate Local Meeting and in 2022 we plan to hold worship monthly at Hartington Grove Meeting House.

Prior to the pandemic, we met (with typically six or seven Friends present) in the Outer Parlour of Pembroke College on Sundays from 1030-1130am.

It is our hope that our occasional visitors and new attenders also find us friendly and welcoming.
