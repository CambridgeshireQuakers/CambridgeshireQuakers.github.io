Ely Meeting is a relatively new, small Local Meeting as Meetings for Worship resumed in 2007. From January 2022 we are meeting each Sunday as a ‘blended’ meeting (online/in person) from 10.30-11.30 in The Aedwen Room, Ely Museum, Ely. If you would like to join this meeting online, please [contact the clerk](mailto:ely-clerk@cambridgeshire-quakers.org.uk) to request joining details.

To reduce the risk of infection the venue has good ventilation (do wear a warm coat) and space for us to sit socially distanced. We ask that you wear a face covering and for the time being we are advising a Lateral Flow Test before Meeting.

Our Meetings for Worship, typically attended by about ten, are more often than not silent. There is an opportunity after the silence to share thoughts which were not given as ministry but are often food for thought.

We do not have a Children’s Meeting at present.
