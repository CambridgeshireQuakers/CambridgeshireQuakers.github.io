We meet each Sunday as a ‘blended’ meeting (online/in person) from 10.30-11.30 in The Aedwen Room, Ely Museum, The Old Gaol, Market St, Ely CB7 4LS.
All are welcome to attend this meeting in person.

Alternatively, if you would like to join the meeting online, please contact the Ely Clerk to receive the Zoom link. 
Further, the Ely Clerk can provide you with directions to find the Aedwen Room in the Museum and advise on parking possibilities.

Our Meetings for Worship are typically attended by at least ten people.

> In the quietness of a Quaker meeting worshippers can become aware of a deep and powerful spirit of love and truth, transcending their ordinary experience.
> We seek to become united in love and strengthened in truth, so we enter a new level of living, despite the different ways we may account for the life-expanding experience

We are welcoming to children but don’t at present have the facilities to run a children’s meeting.
