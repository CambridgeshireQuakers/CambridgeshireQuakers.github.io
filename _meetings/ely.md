The Ely Meeting is a relatively new community: we have been meeting together since 2007. As of January 2022, we have returned to meeting in the Ely Museum (the Aedwen Room; postcode CB7 4LS) where we are offering we are offering ‘Blended’ (online/in-person) Meetings from 1030-1130am on Sundays.

The venue has good ventilation and space for us to sit socially distanced; we ask that you bring and wear a face covering unless exempt. If you would like to join this meeting online, please [contact the clerk](mailto:sue.brock-hollinshead@cambridgeshire-quakers.org.uk) to request joining details.

Our Meetings for Worship, attended by about ten on a typical Sunday, are more often than not silent, which seems to suit us. We usually have an opportunity at the end of that silence to share thoughts and concerns which Friends thought not necessarily appropriate for ministry but which give us valuable food for thought in the days that follow.

We do not have a Children’s Meeting at this time, although we have a few little ones who occasionally join us.
