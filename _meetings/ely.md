The Ely Meeting is a relatively new community. It was restarted in 2008?, and met initially in the Library of the Cathedral. We now meet in the Old Dispensary on St Mary’s Street from 1030-1130am on Sundays.

Our Meetings for Worship, attended by twelve on a typical Sunday, are more often than not silent, which seems to suit us. We have an opportunity at the end of that silence to share thoughts and concerns which Friends thought not necessarily appropriate for ministry but which give us valuable food for thought in the days that follow.

The last Sunday of the month after Meeting for Worship we either have Meetings for Worship for Business or time spent exploring our faith together.

As yet we do not have a Children’s Meeting although we now have three little ones who occasionally join us at the end of Meeting.
