Meeting for Worship is held every Sunday and visitors are always welcome.

**Children’s Meeting** is usually organised on the second Sunday of each month, but does occasionally change. Contact the clerk in advance if possible, if you plan to come with children, so that arrangements can be made.

### Getting to Huntingdon Meeting

Huntingdon Meeting is situated on the main road through Godmanchester, opposite a Chinese Restaurant and a public car park. It is two minutes from the A14 junction by car and a half hour walk from Huntingdon railway station. The meeting house is fully accessible and has a hearing loop.

### Meeting for Worship

Meeting for Worship is held each Sunday at 11 am and lasts for about an hour. In the main meeting room the chairs are set out in a circle with a table in the middle. There are usually flowers, a Bible and several copies of Quaker Faith and Practice on the table.

Meeting for Worship starts as soon as the first person enters the room and sits down. As other Friends enter they join in the silence, taking a seat wherever they feel comfortable. The silence is occasionally broken by spoken ministry, when one of those present feels they have a message which they are being asked to share. On some Sundays the whole hour is passed in silent worship.

After about an hour two Friends, known as Elders, shake hands to signify the end of the meeting. The clerk is asked to read the notices and everyone is invited to stay and chat over a cup of tea or coffee and a biscuit.

### Finding out more

Huntingdon is a small meeting – between 8 and 14 people usually attend meeting for worship. We are always pleased to welcome visitors, whether they are coming to a Quaker meeting for the first time or simply visiting from another area. There is nearly always some connection that can be made and we enjoy making such connections.

Discussion groups, shared lunches, coffee mornings and of course meetings for worship for business are all part of our Quaker community and notice is given well in advance when such events are taking place. We encourage everyone to join in the life of our community as we strive to live out our testimonies to peace, equality, simplicity, truth and sustainability.
